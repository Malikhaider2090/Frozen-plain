Weâ€™ve created a board of images for each of our [Mirage atmosphere products](https://frozenplain.com). We did this to help show you the types of sonic atmosphere and emotion that you can generate with them. Hopefully it will allow you to identify the library that might be useful for your next composition. These images are also present on each of the product pages.
