                    Lost Reveries is designed to be as accessible as possible to producers,
                    composers, musicians, and sound designers. You probably already have what you
                    need if you are producing audio on a reasonably modern computer. There is one
                    exception – Lost Reveries is <span class="text-primary-green"
                        >not available in the AAX plugin format</span

                    higher. Mirage is available as a 64-bit plugin only.

                    chips and M1 chips are supported (universal binary). A host that can play either
                    a VST2 plugin or an AudioUnit v2 (AU) plugin. Examples of such hosts are Cubase,
                    Ableton Live, Studio One, Reaper, Reason, FL Studio, Logic X, Garage Band, and
                    many more. Logic 9 or older does not support AudioUnit v2, and so this product
                    will not work in it.
