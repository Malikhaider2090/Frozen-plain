                        The ambient-tone ‘oscillators’ are categorised into 4 sections: low, mid,
                        air and vocal. The names of these categories suggest how you might use the
                        tone; allowing you to more easily build multi-layered tracks. The vocal
                        category contains ambient tones that resonate similarly to how the human
                        voice makes various vowels sounds.

                        The timbral character of these tone are similar to what you will hear in
                        Hilyard’s music. They are pure, smooth and rich: exploring both earthy,
                        dark-forest ambiences and deep space-drifts. You’ll find a spectrum of
                        light/dark, hopeful/hopeless and terrestrial/extraterrestrial.

                        You might find Lost Reveries useful for creating music in some of these
                        genres: ambient, drone, cinematic, meditation, music-for-sleep or
                        soundtracks. But that isn’t its limit: we’ve also found that the smooth,
                        semi-organic tones of Lost Reveries layer incredibly well with both real
                        orchestration or as a backdrop for synthesisers.
