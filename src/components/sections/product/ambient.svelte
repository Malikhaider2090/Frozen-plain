                        With a typical subtractive synthesiser you might have oscillators like
                        sawtooth, sine or square; in Lost Reveries the ‘oscillators’ are instead
                        sample-based ambient tones. These ambient tones can be shaped using ADSR
                        envelopes, filters and EQ, and layered with other ambient tones. Modulation
                        can also be added using LFOs. Finally, the sound can be coloured using a
                        rack of effects which includes reverb, distortion, chorus and phaser.

                        The samples are made by Hilyard, who used various tone-generation processes;
                        including both real recordings and synthesisied elements. The end-goal was
                        to create the core elements that you can use to design your own
                        multi-layered ambient tones.
