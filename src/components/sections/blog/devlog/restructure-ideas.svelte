                As always, I’ve been working on restructuring the code so that Mirage can be more
                easily maintained. This has been taking up the vast bulk of my time. I’m pleased to
                say however that it’s paying off – I feel confident that the areas that I have
                redesigned are indeed more maintainable. There’s still a lot to do though. For me,
                ‘more maintainable’ encompasses many things that I think will ultimately benefit the
                user of Miragez
            </p>

                An improved ability to automatically test the code will reduce the chance of bugs.

                Better-designed code allows me to add more features and improve performance.

                It also makes it easier for other developers to contribute to Mirage. Having multiple
                developers working on it will increase the rate of new features.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">
                Now however, rather than solely working on restructuring, I’d like to focus more on
                releasing some public betas. Restructuring can be done alongside these public
                releases. I think that having a VST3/CLAP version of Mirage work will be valuable to
                some people so I want to get it available soon..

                I’d like rework the installation process of Mirage. These are some ‘pain points’ in
                the current process:

                I think fixing these will allow people to more quickly and easily use the product to
                make music – and that’s my goal. Here’s my proposed solution:
