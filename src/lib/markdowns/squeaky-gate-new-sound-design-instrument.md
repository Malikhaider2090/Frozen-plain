I'll admit, a squeaky gate sound wouldn't be most people's first choice for something they'd want to use in their music. However, I hope this product delivers something that is actually useful for you to use in your productions. Sometimes a single, constrained idea can be very inspiring.

Even though 'squeak' sounds were the initial sound-source, you'll find a whole array of different sounds in this product, such as basses, synth plucks, pads, 'realistic' strings and distorted lead instruments. This was achieved by utilising all of [Mirage](https://frozenplain.com/mirage/)'s features, such as the volume envelopes, looping controls, and the effects rack.

I made [Squeaky Gate](https://frozenplain.com/product/squeaky-gate/) at various points over the last couple of weeks. It has a smaller scope than other products on this site, but care was taken to match the same high quality. And it's also available for just $10. All in all, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Let me know if you have ideas of other sound design experiments that could be done in this vein!
