I'm delighted to share this new album by "and all was bright" called "feels good lost". It's a beautiful work of ambient music; meandering through serene smooth chords, emotive gritty textures and cinematic darkness. It's also made entirely using FrozenPlain sample libraries plus some effects on top. Thank you for Ben "and all was bright" for creating and sharing this.
