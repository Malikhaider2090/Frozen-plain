Have a look at these 2 excellent videos showing how to make ambient tracks using Mirage and [Mirage libraries](https://frozenplain.com/product-category/mirage-libraries/). They cover topics such as:

- What is Mirage
- Walkthrough of Mirage's key features
- Layering tones, sonic depth of field
- Construction of an ambient track
- Adding other synth elements

They're made by Chris for his YouTube channel [S1gns Of L1fe](https://www.youtube.com/@s1gns0fl1fe), an ambient music-focused audio channel featuring in-depth ambient tutorials, full track walkthroughs, synthesis techniques, plug-in deep dives, and tons more.

FrozenPlain sponsored the production of the first video.
